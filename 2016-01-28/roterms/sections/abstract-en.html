<h2>Abstract</h2><p>The Research Object vocabularies are built on existing popular vocabularies and standards, such as ORE, DC terms, PROV, to cite a few. In addition to terms that we borrowed and adapted from such vocabularies, we defined new terms under the name space roterms.

These new terms serve two main purposes. They are used to specify annotations that are, to our knowledge, not catered for by existing ontologies, e.g., roterms:Hypothesis and roterms:exampleValue. ii) They are also used to specify shortcuts that make the ontology easy to use and more accessible. </p>
