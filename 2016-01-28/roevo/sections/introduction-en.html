<h2>1. Introduction <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
<p>Research Object Evolution refers to the ability of managing changes in a research object and its aggregated resources by creating and maintaining different versions of the research object during its life-cycle. It provides a detailed description of the changes in these resources, tracking contributions reused from other sources. It, thus, enables tracing the progress of a Research Object and accessing concrete versions of a Research Object (and their aggregated resources) or individual resources (notably workflows). 
<p></p>
The Research Object Evolution model enables the representation of the different stages of the Research Objects life-cycle, their dependencies, as well as the corresponding versions of Research Objects and their aggregated resources, with the associated changes in these resources. The concrete realization of this model is the roevo Ontology and it is built on top of the core ro ontologies.</p>
