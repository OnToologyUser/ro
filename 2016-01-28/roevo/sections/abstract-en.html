<h2>Abstract</h2><p>The Research Object Evolution Ontology (roevo) extends the ro ontology to capture the lifecycle and versioning of research objects (ROs). Roevo is also an extension of PROV ontology for describing Research Object evolution provenance.  Roevo enables the representation of the different stages of the ROs lifecycle, their dependencies, as well as the corresponding versions of ROs and their aggregated resources, with the associated changes in these resources. Roevo follows a modular approach, enabling the creation of extensions for modeling detailed taxonomies of changes for particular resources, e.g., workflows.</p>
<p> Additional information about roevo and background information is available at <a href="http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+evolution">http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+evolution</a></p>
