<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The wfprov ontology shows how to express minimal provenance information about the execution of a workflow described using the wf ontology.

Here the concern is mainly the provenance which affects the research object, so in particular how some ro:Resource's might have been generated or used by the execution of a wfdesc:Workflow.

The main class here is a wfprov:WorkflowRun which shows how wfprov:Artifact instances (the data) wfprov:wasOutputFrom a wfprov:ProcessRun for generated artifacts, or wfprov:usedInput for consumed artifacts. The WorkflowRun is also a ProcessRun, and so the overall inputs and outputs of thw workflow execution can be described in the same manner.

These provenance details are linked to the corresponding wfdesc descriptions using wfdesc:describedbyProcess, wfdesc:describedByWorkflow and wfdesc:describedByParameter.


This ontology can be further linked to more specific provenance ontologies like OPM-V or W3C PROV-O, but this should be done separately.</span>
