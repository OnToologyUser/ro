<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology ("wfdesc") describes an abstract workflow description structure, which on the top level is defined as a wfdesc:Workflow.

A wfdesc:Workflow contains several wfdesc:Process instances, associated using the wfdesc:hasSubProcess property. Each of these (and the workflow itself) wfdesc:hasInput and wfdesc:hasOutput some wfdesc:Parameter (wfdesc:Input or wfdesc:Output). An wfdesc:Artifact is associated with a wfdesc:Parameter using wfdesc:hasArtifact. The wfdesc:Workflow also wfdesc:hasDataLink several wfdesc:DataLink instances, which forms the connection between parameters.

Thus this ontology allows the description a direct acyclic graph, or a dataflow.

This ontology is meant as an upper ontology for more specific workflow definitions, and as a way to express abstract workflows. The wfprov ontology shows how to link these descriptions to a provenance trace of a workflow execution.</span>
